### Pong Game built with Godot Game Engine and GDScript, find more about it on [Godot Website](https://godotengine.org/)
### This is the first game done with Godot and I followed a YouTube Tutorial - [Learn Godot by creating Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr1BoEbuveI) from [ClearCode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCznj32AM2r98hZfTxrRo9bQ) which you definetly want check out if you are interested in.

### I added android support as well. Download it from releases and play it (if you want I mean, cuz it's just nothin more than a simple Pong Game)
